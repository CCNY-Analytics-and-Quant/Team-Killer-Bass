Logic Assignment — Put on a coat

    Why am I putting on a coat?
	Because I am preparing to go outside

How do I properly prepare to go outside?

What is the weather like outside?
It is 40 degrees Fahrenheit, and it is raining.  

What kind of coat do I need?
I would need a raincoat that could also keep me warm in cold weather

What else do I need to go outside in the rain?
    An umbrella
    Rain boots
    A bag to put my umbrella in
    
How do I put on a raincoat?
    Start by grabbing the collar of the coat with one hand.
    Take the opposite arm and send it through the corresponding coat sleeve (if you have long sleeves, grab the sleeve with your hand so that it doesn’t bunch up).
    Then take your other arm and put it through the corresponding coat sleeve.
    Once you have both sleeves on, close the zipper on your coat.
