Logic Assignment â€” Do a load of laundry

How do I clean my clothes?
    What type of laundry am I doing?
        What color clothes need to be washed (white, light, or dark)?
            In our theoretical load of laundry, most of our laundry, since most of the laundry that needs to be done is light colored, then I will only wash the light colored laundry. 
    What do the care labels say?
        Does it say to hand wash, dry clean, or machine wash?
            Since all of our clothes say that they can be machine washed, we will be using the washing machine. 
        How do you machine wash clothes?
            You first load the washer by transferring the clothes from the laundry basket into the washer.
            Then, set the wash cycle accordingly (our load will use the normal cycle setting).
            Then, set the water temperature according to the care label (all of the clothes in our load require cool temperature water).
            Then, pour the detergent into the slot for detergent. 
            Then, press the start button, and wait for the washer to finish.
            Remove the clothes from the washer and load them into the laundry basket. 
    Can you dry the clothes in the dryer or not?
        Since not all of the clothes say they can be put in the dryer, we will be air drying them. 
        How do you air dry clothes?
            Go to the drying rack.
            Take the clothes from the laundry basket, and hang each article of clothing one at a time on a hanger.
            Take the hanger, and hang it on the drying rack.
            Place some fans under the clothes to expedite the drying process.
