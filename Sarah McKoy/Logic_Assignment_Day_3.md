Logic Assignment — Set the table for dinner

How should I prepare for dinner?
    What kind of food are we eating?
    Takeout
    If we are eating takeout, then we don’t need to set the table, because everything (forks, knives, plates, etc.) are included in the package. 
    Home Cooked Meal
    If we are eating a home cooked meal, then it would be necessary to set up the table. 
    How will the food be eaten?
    Is it food you eat with your hands?
    If yes, then forks, knives, and spoons wouldn’t be necessary. You would only need plates and napkins. 
    If not, then you would possibly need forks, knives, and spoons, as well as plates and napkins. 
    Is the food liquidy (soup, etc.)
    If yes, then you would need a spoon, but not forks or knives.
    If not, then you probably would not need a spoon. 
    Are we drinking anything?
    If yes, then we need to set a cup at the table.
    If not, then there is no need for a cup. 
    How many people are eating?
    Depending on how many people are eating, we need to set up a plate for each person. 

Ex: We are having home cooked steak and Pepsi for dinner for 4 people. 
Since the meal is home cooked, we will need to set up the table.
Steak cannot be eaten with your hand, nor is it liquidy. 
Therefore, we need utensils, but we only need a fork and knife. 
Since we will be having drinks, we need to set up cups.
Since 4 people will be eating, we will set up 4 plates. 
Steps:
First, place a plate at each of the four chairs at the dinner table.
On the left of each plate, place a folded napkin there. Then on top of the napkin, place a fork. 
On the right of each plate, place a knife. 
On the top right corner, place a cup for the drinks. 

What do we need?
Table
Chairs
Plates
Napkins
Forks 
Knives
Cups
